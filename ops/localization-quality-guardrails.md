# Localization Quality Guardrails (No MT Spam)

## Non-Negotiables
- Do not mass-publish raw machine translation.
- Each localized page must be intent-reviewed by a human.
- Keep L&D and training operations as the primary ICP.

## Quality Checklist (Per Page)
- [ ] Title and meta adapted to local search phrasing (not literal translation)
- [ ] Intro references local business context where relevant
- [ ] Core terms (L&D, onboarding, compliance, SOP) are natural in target language
- [ ] Internal links valid and useful in that language journey
- [ ] Hreflang and canonical tags implemented correctly
- [ ] No duplicate/thin content with only token substitutions

## Rollout Guardrails
- Launch fewer pages with quality instead of bulk low-quality pages
- Expand only after indexing and engagement signals are positive
- Re-review top landing pages monthly for terminology and conversion clarity
