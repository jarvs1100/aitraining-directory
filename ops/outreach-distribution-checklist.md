# Organic Outreach & Distribution Checklist (No Paid Ads)

## Daily Distribution Targets
- [ ] Publish 1 supporting post on LinkedIn from founder/company profile
- [ ] Share 1 use-case page in a relevant L&D or enablement community
- [ ] Answer 2 relevant questions on Reddit/Quora with contextual directory link
- [ ] Refresh 1 existing post with updated comparison/internal links
- [ ] Reach out to 3 tool vendors listed in the directory for link inclusion

## Free Channels to Prioritize
- LinkedIn (L&D leaders, enablement operators, HR ops)
- Reddit communities (r/instructionaldesign, r/elearning, r/LnD, role-specific subreddits)
- Niche Slack/Discord groups for training and enablement
- Founder newsletter mention swaps
- Tool partner pages and integrations pages

## Weekly Assets to Ship
- [ ] 2 comparison pages
- [ ] 3 use-case pages
- [ ] 1 industry page refresh

## Messaging Angle
- Lead with practical L&D outcomes: onboarding speed, policy update turnaround, training consistency.
- Mention automation assistants (e.g., OpenClaw bots) only as secondary operational support.

## Link-Building Without Spam
- Offer co-marketing snippets to listed vendors
- Ask for inclusion in “resources” pages where contextually relevant
- Repurpose comparisons into short social carousels linking back to canonical pages
- Never buy links, automate spam, or use doorway tactics
