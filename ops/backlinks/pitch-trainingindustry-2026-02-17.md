# Pitch: Training Industry — Expert Quote/Article

**Subject:** Evidence-Based L&D Tech Evaluation: A Pilot-First Framework

Hi [Editor],

Most L&D teams evaluate AI tools by demo → shortlist → procurement. The result: shelfware, buyer's remorse, and governance gaps.

I built a pilot-first evaluation checklist based on 4 dimensions: workflow-fit, governance, localization, implementation burden. It's conservative, operational, and designed for compliance-sensitive environments.

**Expert quote angle:**
"L&D buyers should stop optimizing for demo polish and start measuring reviewer burden and update latency. A tool that ships fast but requires heavy rework after feedback isn't cheaper—it's a capacity trap."

**Why Training Industry readers care:**
- Procurement is getting harder (more vendors, less clarity)
- Compliance teams are pushing back on ungoverned AI adoption
- Pilot failures are expensive in time and political capital
