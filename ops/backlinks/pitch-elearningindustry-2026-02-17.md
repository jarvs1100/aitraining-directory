# Pitch: eLearning Industry — Guest Contribution

**Subject:** AI Literacy Compliance Comparison Framework for EU AI Act

Hi [Editor Name],

I built a practical comparison framework for L&D teams navigating EU AI Act Article 4 literacy requirements. Most coverage focuses on legal interpretation; this focuses on implementation: how to choose between role-based AI literacy platforms vs. generic compliance courses.

**Asset:** https://aitraining.directory/compare/ai-literacy-training-platforms-vs-general-compliance-courses-for-eu-ai-act-readiness/

**Angle:** A decision matrix and pilot framework for compliance officers who need defensible evidence trails, not just completion metrics.

**Why eLearning Industry readers care:**
- EU AI Act deadlines approaching (2025-2026)
- Article 4 has teeth (fines up to 7% global turnover)
- Most teams haven't operationalized literacy yet

**Guest contribution options:**
1. Full article: "How to Pilot AI Literacy Training Under EU AI Act Article 4"
2. Expert quote: 2-3 sentences on literacy platform selection criteria
3. Resource roundup: Include in AI compliance tools list

**About the source:**
I run AI Training Directory (aitraining.directory), a curated resource for L&D teams evaluating AI tools. We focus on implementation-led comparisons, not feature checklists.

Happy to adjust angle or format to fit editorial needs.

Best,
Adam
