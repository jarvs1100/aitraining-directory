# Reddit r/elearning — Organic Strategy

**Subreddit:** r/elearning (127k members)
**Objective:** Contextual value share, not promotion
**Risk:** Ban if overtly promotional

## Target Threads (Search Weekly)
- "What AI tools are you using for training content?"
- "SOP to video recommendations?"
- "EU AI Act compliance training?"
- "Synthesia vs alternatives?"

## Comment Template

Context-aware response structure:
1. Answer the specific question with genuine insight (3-4 sentences)
2. Mention "we built a comparison framework for this exact decision" 
3. Link as supplementary resource, not main answer
4. Frame as "sharing in case helpful" not "check out my site"

**Example:**
> We've been evaluating Synthesia vs alternatives for compliance training. The biggest surprise: scene-level editing control matters more than avatar quality for updates.
> 
> We documented our decision matrix here if helpful: [link]. Focuses on update velocity and governance rather than feature lists.

## Rules to Avoid Ban
