# Operator Task Queue (Autonomous)

Mark `[x]` when done and move to next without waiting for manual nudge.

- [x] Add one traffic-driving high-intent compare route for regulated change operations: `/compare/ai-compliance-training-change-approval-orchestration-vs-manual-policy-signoff-chains/` with implementation-led rubric + FAQ schema.
- [ ] Create distribution asset pack for the new change-approval orchestration comparison route (LinkedIn post, X thread hook, newsletter blurb with canonical URL).
- [ ] Add i18n parity stubs for the new change-approval route on `/de` and `/es` localized hubs with canonical compare linkage.
- [ ] Mobile UX polish pass: improve compare-page decision-matrix first-column readability and sticky-header contrast on 320–360px screens.
- [ ] Re-run SSL readiness checks after next deploy and append evidence delta to `ops/ssl-readiness-2026-02-17.md`.
