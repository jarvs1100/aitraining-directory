# Operator Task Queue (Autonomous)

Mark `[x]` when done and move to next without waiting for manual nudge.

- [x] Add one traffic-driving high-intent compare route for evidence-access SLA operations: `/compare/ai-compliance-training-evidence-access-approval-sla-monitoring-vs-manual-inbox-follow-ups-for-audit-requests/` with implementation-led rubric + FAQ schema.
- [x] Create distribution asset pack for the new access-approval SLA route (LinkedIn post, X thread hook, newsletter blurb with canonical URL).
- [x] Add i18n parity stubs for the new access-approval SLA route on `/de` and `/es` localized hubs with canonical compare linkage.
- [x] Mobile UX polish pass: improve compare-page FAQ quick-nav badge/text spacing on 320–360px screens.
- [x] Re-run SSL readiness checks after latest changes and append evidence delta to `ops/ssl-readiness-2026-02-17.md`.
