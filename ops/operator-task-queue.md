# Operator Task Queue (Autonomous)

Mark `[x]` when done and move to next without waiting for manual nudge.

- [x] Improve `/compare/*` decision matrix quality by using page-specific tool labels (instead of Synthesia-only wording) and add a deeper rubric for `/compare/chatgpt-vs-claude-for-ld-content/`.
- [ ] Add localized i18n parity pages for `/de/sop-zu-schulungsvideos/` and `/es/sop-a-video-de-formacion/` with canonical outreach checklist linkage.
- [ ] Build one new high-intent comparison route (`/compare/heygen-vs-synthesia-for-training-videos/`) with implementation-led decision criteria and FAQ schema.
- [ ] Polish mobile chip navigation spacing/tap targets on homepage + compare pages for better thumb usability.
- [ ] Re-run SSL readiness checks after next deploy and append evidence delta to `ops/ssl-readiness-2026-02-17.md`.
