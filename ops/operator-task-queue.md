Mark `[x]` when done and move to next without waiting for manual nudge.

- [ ] Add one traffic-driving high-intent compare route for compliance execution analytics: `/compare/ai-training-control-effectiveness-scoring-vs-manual-audit-sampling-for-compliance-assurance/` with implementation-led rubric + FAQ schema.
- [ ] Create distribution asset pack for the control-effectiveness comparison route (LinkedIn post, X thread hook, newsletter blurb with canonical URL).
