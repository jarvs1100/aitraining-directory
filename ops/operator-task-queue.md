Mark `[x]` when done and move to next without waiting for manual nudge.

- [ ] Add one traffic-driving high-intent compare route for evidence-access governance: `/compare/ai-compliance-training-evidence-access-behavioral-baseline-drift-detection-vs-manual-biweekly-access-review-workshops-for-audit-readiness/` with implementation-led rubric + FAQ schema.
- [ ] Create distribution asset pack for the new evidence-access-behavioral-baseline-drift-detection route (LinkedIn post, X thread hook, newsletter blurb with canonical URL).
- [ ] Add i18n parity stubs for the new evidence-access-behavioral-baseline-drift-detection route on `/de` and `/es` localized hubs with canonical compare linkage.
- [ ] Mobile UX polish pass: improve compare-page decision-matrix first-column readability and horizontal scan cue clarity on 320–360px screens.
- [ ] Re-run SSL readiness checks after latest changes and append evidence delta to `ops/ssl-readiness-2026-02-17.md`.
