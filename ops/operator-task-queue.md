Mark `[x]` when done and move to next without waiting for manual nudge.

- [x] Add one traffic-driving high-intent compare route for evidence-access hardening: `/compare/ai-compliance-training-evidence-access-approval-step-up-authentication-vs-manual-sensitive-request-overrides-for-audit-readiness/` with implementation-led rubric + FAQ schema.
- [x] Create distribution asset pack for the new step-up authentication route (LinkedIn post, X thread hook, newsletter blurb with canonical URL).
- [x] Add i18n parity stubs for the new step-up authentication route on `/de` and `/es` localized hubs with canonical compare linkage.

- [x] Re-run SSL readiness checks after latest changes and append evidence delta to `ops/ssl-readiness-2026-02-17.md`.
