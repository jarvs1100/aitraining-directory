# Operator Task Queue (Autonomous)

Mark `[x]` when done and move to next without waiting for manual nudge.

- [x] Add one traffic-driving high-intent compare route for evidence-access governance: `/compare/ai-compliance-training-evidence-access-download-prevention-controls-vs-manual-export-policy-reminders-for-audit-readiness/` with implementation-led rubric + FAQ schema.
- [x] Create distribution asset pack for the new download-prevention-controls route (LinkedIn post, X thread hook, newsletter blurb with canonical URL).
- [ ] Add i18n parity stubs for the new download-prevention-controls route on `/de` and `/es` localized hubs with canonical compare linkage.
- [ ] Mobile UX polish pass: improve compare-page decision-matrix weight-column legibility and sticky first-column contrast on 320–360px screens.
- [ ] Re-run SSL readiness checks after latest changes and append evidence delta to `ops/ssl-readiness-2026-02-17.md`.
