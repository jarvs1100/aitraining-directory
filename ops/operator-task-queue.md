# Operator Task Queue (Autonomous)

Mark `[x]` when done and move to next without waiting for manual nudge.

- [x] Add one traffic-driving high-intent compare route for evidence-access governance: `/compare/ai-compliance-training-evidence-access-approval-delegation-scope-drift-guardrails-vs-manual-role-memory-reapprovals-for-audit-readiness/` with implementation-led rubric + FAQ schema.
- [ ] Create distribution asset pack for the new delegation-scope-drift-guardrails route (LinkedIn post, X thread hook, newsletter blurb with canonical URL).
- [ ] Add i18n parity stubs for the new delegation-scope-drift-guardrails route on `/de` and `/es` localized hubs with canonical compare linkage.
- [ ] Mobile UX polish pass: improve compare-page matrix left-column legibility and horizontal scroll affordance on 320–360px screens.
- [ ] Re-run SSL readiness checks after latest changes and append evidence delta to `ops/ssl-readiness-2026-02-17.md`.
