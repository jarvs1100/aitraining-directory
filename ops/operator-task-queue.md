# Operator Task Queue (Autonomous)

Mark `[x]` when done and move to next without waiting for manual nudge.

- [ ] Add one traffic-driving high-intent compare route for audit packet operations: `/compare/ai-compliance-audit-packet-assembly-vs-manual-evidence-binders-for-training-programs/` with implementation-led rubric + FAQ schema.
- [ ] Create distribution asset pack for the audit-packet assembly comparison route (LinkedIn post, X thread hook, newsletter blurb with canonical URL).
- [ ] Add i18n parity stubs for the new audit-packet route on `/de` and `/es` localized hubs with canonical compare linkage.
- [ ] Mobile UX polish pass: improve compare-page decision-matrix card divider contrast + spacing on 360–390px screens.
- [ ] Re-run SSL readiness checks after next deploy and append evidence delta to `ops/ssl-readiness-2026-02-17.md`.
