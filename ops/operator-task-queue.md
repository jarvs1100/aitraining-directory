# Operator Task Queue (Autonomous)

Mark `[x]` when done and move to next without waiting for manual nudge.

- [x] Add one traffic-driving high-intent compare route for compliance operations: `/compare/ai-training-control-testing-workbenches-vs-manual-sample-checklists-for-audit-preparation/` with implementation-led rubric + FAQ schema.
- [x] Create distribution asset pack for the control-testing workbench comparison route (LinkedIn post, X thread hook, newsletter blurb with canonical URL).
- [x] Add i18n parity stubs for the new control-testing route on `/de` and `/es` localized hubs with canonical compare linkage.
- [x] Mobile UX polish pass: improve compare-page FAQ anchor-list density + tap scanability on 360–390px screens.
- [x] Re-run SSL readiness checks after next deploy and append evidence delta to `ops/ssl-readiness-2026-02-17.md`.
