Changes pushed at commit `c55a725`. Next task: create distribution asset pack for the new evidence-SLA orchestration comparison route (LinkedIn post, X thread hook, newsletter blurb with canonical URL).
- 2026-02-17 17:41 UTC: Completed remaining evidence-SLA queue items in sequence: created distribution asset pack for `/compare/ai-compliance-evidence-sla-orchestration-vs-manual-ticket-escalations-for-training-audits/` in `ops/distribution-assets-2026-02-17.md`, added de/es i18n parity stubs (`/de/ki-compliance-evidence-sla-orchestrierung-vs-manuelle-ticket-eskalationen-fuer-training-audits/`, `/es/orquestacion-sla-evidencia-compliance-ia-vs-escalaciones-manuales-tickets-auditorias-training/`) linked to canonical route, polished compare-page FAQ anchor line-wrap + vertical rhythm on 360–390px screens, and appended fresh SSL readiness evidence delta in `ops/ssl-readiness-2026-02-17.md` (`qa:https` passed with 236 HTML files; apex HTTPS `HTTP/2 200`; `www` HTTPS redirects to apex). Changes pushed across commits `3f53f17`, `d01e13f`, `7a02683`, and `92d0e5b` (latest). Next task: queue exhausted — refill `ops/operator-task-queue.md` with next highest-impact traffic-driving content, i18n parity, mobile UX polish, distribution assets, and SSL follow-up checks.
