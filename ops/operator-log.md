- 2026-02-17 05:54 UTC: Added HTTPS readiness QA (qa:https) to scan built docs for insecure links/canonicals/sitemap/robots; build + i18n QA + HTTPS QA all passed.
- 2026-02-17 06:10 UTC: Expanded `/solutions/sop-to-video-training/` with implementation checklist depth, common pitfalls, and internal planning links (including compare route). Build passed and changes pushed at commit `6ed6b69`. Next task: expand `/compare/synthesia-alternatives/` with a decision matrix and buying criteria.
- 2026-02-17 06:13 UTC: Expanded `/compare/synthesia-alternatives/` with weighted decision matrix + buying criteria; improved homepage trust proof and added distribution micro-playbook link; localized nav/announcement CTAs on localized hubs; re-checked SSL readiness with fresh DNS/TLS/curl evidence in `ops/ssl-readiness-2026-02-17.md` (still cert mismatch on custom domain). Build + `qa:https` passed. Changes pushed at commit `4055fd2`. Next task: refill operator queue with next highest-impact traffic + mobile UX opportunities.
- 2026-02-17 06:24 UTC: Shipped mobile UX polish for compare pages by adding responsive decision-matrix cards (replacing horizontal-only mobile table experience), plus table styling for desktop readability; refreshed operator queue with next traffic/i18n/SSL tasks. Build + `qa:https` passed. Changes pushed at commit `15516ce`. Next task: add internal-link modules to high-intent tool pages (`/tool/synthesia/`, `/tool/loom/`, `/tool/guidde/`) to improve distribution path depth.
- 2026-02-17 06:25 UTC: Added internal-link modules on high-intent tool pages (`/tool/synthesia/`, `/tool/descript/`, `/tool/elevenlabs/`) to drive deeper compare/solution navigation paths and updated queue references to match existing tool inventory. Build + `qa:https` passed. Changes pushed at commit `f0bd3d9`. Next task: create localized distribution-playbook stubs for `/pl,/cs,/sk,/hu,/de,/es` with links back to canonical checklist.
- 2026-02-17 06:41 UTC: Created localized distribution-playbook stubs for `/pl,/cs,/sk,/hu,/de,/es` (with direct links to canonical outreach checklist), added homepage FAQ section + FAQPage schema, and added concise "Last reviewed" metadata block for trust signals. `npm run build` passed after source changes. Changes pushed at commit `22891ba`. Next task: run SSL readiness re-check after next deploy and capture fresh evidence in `ops/ssl-readiness-2026-02-17.md`.
- 2026-02-17 06:42 UTC: Ran post-deploy SSL readiness re-check and refreshed `ops/ssl-readiness-2026-02-17.md` with fresh QA/DNS/TLS/curl evidence. Result unchanged: DNS and HTTP are live, but HTTPS still fails hostname validation due to `CN=*.github.io` certificate. Next task: refill operator queue with next highest-impact traffic + conversion opportunities once SSL provisioning state changes.
- 2026-02-17 06:55 UTC: Improved compare-page content quality by replacing Synthesia-only decision-matrix labeling with slug-aware tool labels and shipped a deeper, implementation-led rubric for `/compare/chatgpt-vs-claude-for-ld-content/`. Ran `npm run build` and `npm run qa:https` (both passed). Changes pushed at commit `b040db5`. Next task: add a new high-intent comparison route (`/compare/heygen-vs-synthesia-for-training-videos/`) with decision criteria and FAQ schema.
- 2026-02-17 06:56 UTC: Verified de/es SOP i18n parity was already live (`/de/sop-zu-schulungsvideos-mit-ki/`, `/es/de-sop-a-video-de-formacion-con-ia/`) and shipped new route `/compare/heygen-vs-synthesia-for-training-videos/` with implementation-led decision matrix content. Ran `npm run build` and `npm run qa:https` (both passed). Changes pushed at commit `cd2e562`. Next task: polish mobile chip navigation spacing/tap targets on homepage + compare pages.
- 2026-02-17 07:11 UTC: Shipped mobile chip-navigation tap-target polish across homepage + compare routes (`.chips-nav`, 44px min target on mobile), added high-intent internal-link CTA block on `/compare/`, and re-ran SSL readiness checks with appended evidence delta in `ops/ssl-readiness-2026-02-17.md` (HTTPS cert mismatch still unresolved: `CN=*.github.io`). Ran `npm run build` and `npm run qa:https` (both passed). Changes pushed at commit `03eaa3c`. Next task: create high-intent comparison route `/compare/ai-dubbing-vs-subtitles-for-compliance-training/` with implementation rubric + FAQ schema.
- 2026-02-17 07:12 UTC: Added new high-intent comparison route `/compare/ai-dubbing-vs-subtitles-for-compliance-training/` with implementation-weighted decision matrix + buying criteria and inherited FAQ schema output. Ran `npm run build` and `npm run qa:https` (both passed, 114 HTML files checked). Changes pushed at commit `96569b9`. Next task: mobile UX polish pass for localized landing pages (`/pl,/cs,/sk,/hu,/de,/es`) to improve nav tap-target + spacing parity.
- 2026-02-17 07:25 UTC: Completed localized mobile top-nav UX parity on `/pl,/cs,/sk,/hu,/de,/es` (44px tap target, spacing/line-height polish, single-column localized mobile nav) and fixed localized top-nav routing to localized sections. Added compliance-route distribution asset pack at `ops/distribution-assets-2026-02-17.md`; refreshed SSL readiness evidence delta (115 HTML files checked; cert mismatch still `CN=*.github.io`). Changes pushed at commit `bea8463`. Next task: add traffic-driving high-intent compare route for SCORM/LMS workflow evaluation.
