- 2026-02-17 05:54 UTC: Added HTTPS readiness QA (qa:https) to scan built docs for insecure links/canonicals/sitemap/robots; build + i18n QA + HTTPS QA all passed.
- 2026-02-17 06:10 UTC: Expanded `/solutions/sop-to-video-training/` with implementation checklist depth, common pitfalls, and internal planning links (including compare route). Build passed and changes pushed at commit `6ed6b69`. Next task: expand `/compare/synthesia-alternatives/` with a decision matrix and buying criteria.
- 2026-02-17 06:13 UTC: Expanded `/compare/synthesia-alternatives/` with weighted decision matrix + buying criteria; improved homepage trust proof and added distribution micro-playbook link; localized nav/announcement CTAs on localized hubs; re-checked SSL readiness with fresh DNS/TLS/curl evidence in `ops/ssl-readiness-2026-02-17.md` (still cert mismatch on custom domain). Build + `qa:https` passed. Changes pushed at commit `4055fd2`. Next task: refill operator queue with next highest-impact traffic + mobile UX opportunities.
- 2026-02-17 06:24 UTC: Shipped mobile UX polish for compare pages by adding responsive decision-matrix cards (replacing horizontal-only mobile table experience), plus table styling for desktop readability; refreshed operator queue with next traffic/i18n/SSL tasks. Build + `qa:https` passed. Changes pushed at commit `15516ce`. Next task: add internal-link modules to high-intent tool pages (`/tool/synthesia/`, `/tool/loom/`, `/tool/guidde/`) to improve distribution path depth.
- 2026-02-17 06:25 UTC: Added internal-link modules on high-intent tool pages (`/tool/synthesia/`, `/tool/descript/`, `/tool/elevenlabs/`) to drive deeper compare/solution navigation paths and updated queue references to match existing tool inventory. Build + `qa:https` passed. Changes pushed at commit `f0bd3d9`. Next task: create localized distribution-playbook stubs for `/pl,/cs,/sk,/hu,/de,/es` with links back to canonical checklist.
- 2026-02-17 06:41 UTC: Created localized distribution-playbook stubs for `/pl,/cs,/sk,/hu,/de,/es` (with direct links to canonical outreach checklist), added homepage FAQ section + FAQPage schema, and added concise "Last reviewed" metadata block for trust signals. `npm run build` passed after source changes. Changes pushed at commit `22891ba`. Next task: run SSL readiness re-check after next deploy and capture fresh evidence in `ops/ssl-readiness-2026-02-17.md`.
- 2026-02-17 06:42 UTC: Ran post-deploy SSL readiness re-check and refreshed `ops/ssl-readiness-2026-02-17.md` with fresh QA/DNS/TLS/curl evidence. Result unchanged: DNS and HTTP are live, but HTTPS still fails hostname validation due to `CN=*.github.io` certificate. Next task: refill operator queue with next highest-impact traffic + conversion opportunities once SSL provisioning state changes.
